# Progress

## Current Status

The Sprose application is in a functional state with all core features implemented. It provides a hierarchical item management system that allows users to organize their thoughts in a tree structure.

## What Works

### Core Functionality

- ✅ Creating new items
- ✅ Editing existing items
- ✅ Deleting items
- ✅ Organizing items in a hierarchical structure
- ✅ Expanding and collapsing item trees

### Drag and Drop

- ✅ Dragging items to reorder within the same parent
- ✅ Dragging items to move between different parents
- ✅ Visual indicators for drop targets

### Clipboard Integration

- ✅ Copying items as Markdown
- ✅ Pasting Markdown as new items
- ✅ System clipboard integration

### History Management

- ✅ Undo functionality
- ✅ Redo functionality
- ✅ History stack with limit of 100 entries

### User Interface

- ✅ Clean, modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Responsive layout
- ✅ Context menus for additional actions
- ✅ Tooltips for better usability
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts for common actions

### Data Persistence

- ✅ Local storage using LocalForage
- ✅ Automatic saving of changes

### Development Infrastructure

- ✅ TypeScript for type safety
- ✅ Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- ✅ Biome for linting and formatting
- ✅ Vitest for testing
- ✅ React Router for routing and data management

## What's Left to Build

### Enhanced Export/Import

- ❌ Direct file export/import functionality
- ❌ Support for additional formats beyond Markdown
- ❌ Bulk export/import of multiple items

### Performance Optimizations

- ❌ Optimized recursive tree operations for large trees
- ❌ Virtualization for rendering large trees
- ❌ Lazy loading of deeply nested items

### Collaboration Features

- ❌ Real-time collaboration
- ❌ Server-side storage and synchronization
- ❌ User authentication and authorization
- ❌ Sharing capabilities

### Enhanced Editing

- ❌ Rich text editing
- ❌ Support for images and other media
- ❌ Formatting options beyond plain text
- ❌ Tagging and categorization

### Mobile Support

- ❌ Touch-friendly interactions
- ❌ Mobile-optimized layout
- ❌ Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- ❌ Offline support

### Additional Features

- ❌ Search functionality
- ❌ Filtering options
- ❌ Multiple maps/documents
- ❌ Templates for common use cases
- ❌ Themes and customization options

## Known Issues

1. **Performance with Large Trees**: Recursive operations on deeply nested trees could become performance bottlenecks.

2. **Browser Storage Limitations**: Browser storage quotas limit the amount of data that can be stored, with no fallback mechanism.

3. **Limited Export Options**: Currently, export is limited to clipboard operations with no direct file export.

4. **No Data Backup**: No built-in mechanism for backing up data beyond the browser's local storage.

5. **Single Document**: Currently only supports a single document/map at a time.

## Next Milestones

### Short-term (1-2 months)

1. Add direct file export/import functionality
2. Implement search and filtering capabilities
3. Add support for multiple maps/documents
4. Improve performance with large trees

### Medium-term (3-6 months)

1. Implement rich text editing
2. Add support for images and other media
3. Develop mobile-optimized layout and interactions
4. Create themes and customization options

### Long-term (6+ months)

1. Implement real-time collaboration features
2. Develop server-side storage and synchronization
3. Add user authentication and authorization
4. Create sharing capabilities

## Recent Achievements

The project has successfully implemented all core functionality for hierarchical item management, including:

1. A clean, intuitive user interface
2. Drag and drop capabilities for item organization
3. Clipboard integration for Markdown import/export
4. History management with undo/redo functionality
5. Local storage for data persistence

## Current Development Focus

The current development focus is on stabilizing the existing features and preparing for the next phase of development, which will likely include:

1. Enhanced export/import capabilities
2. Performance optimizations for large trees
3. Search and filtering functionality
4. Support for multiple maps/documents
