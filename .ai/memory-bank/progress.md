- ✅ Dragging items to move between different parents
- ✅ Visual indicators for drop targets
- ✅ Custom drag and drop implementation

### Clipboard Integration

- ✅ Copying items as Markdown
- ✅ Copying items as HTML
- ✅ Pasting Markdown as new items
- ✅ Pasting HTML as new items
- ✅ System clipboard integration

### History Management

- ❌ Lazy loading of deeply nested items
- ❌ Optimized history management for large trees

### Multiple Documents

- ❌ Support for multiple maps/documents
- ❌ Document management interface
- ❌ Templates for common use cases
- ❌ Document organization and categorization

### Search and Filtering

- ❌ Search functionality to find items by content
- ❌ Filtering options to show/hide items based on criteria
- ❌ Tagging and categorization
- ❌ Advanced search with regular expressions

### Enhanced Editing

- ❌ Rich text editing
- ❌ Support for images and other media
- ❌ Formatting options beyond plain text
- ❌ Markdown preview
- ❌ Syntax highlighting

### Collaboration Features

- ❌ Real-time collaboration
- ❌ Server-side storage and synchronization
- ❌ User authentication and authorization
- ❌ Sharing capabilities
- ❌ Comments and annotations

### Mobile Support

- ❌ Touch-friendly interactions
- ❌ Mobile-optimized layout
- ❌ Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- ❌ Offline support
- ❌ Responsive design for small screens

### Additional Features

- ❌ Themes and customization options
- ❌ Keyboard navigation between items
- ❌ Focus mode for distraction-free editing
- ❌ Statistics and analytics
- ❌ Data backup and restore

## Known Issues

1. **Performance with Large Trees**: Recursive operations on deeply nested trees could become performance bottlenecks.

2. **Browser Storage Limitations**: Browser storage quotas limit the amount of data that can be stored, with no fallback mechanism.

3. **Limited Export Options**: Currently, export is limited to clipboard operations with no direct file export.

4. **No Data Backup**: No built-in mechanism for backing up data beyond the browser's local storage.

5. **Single Document**: Currently only supports a single document/map at a time.

6. **No Offline Support**: While the app works offline, there's no explicit offline mode or sync mechanism when connection is restored.

7. **Limited Mobile Support**: The UI is not fully optimized for mobile devices, especially for drag and drop operations.

## Next Milestones

### Short-term (1-2 months)

1. Add direct file export/import functionality
2. Implement search and filtering capabilities
3. Add support for multiple maps/documents
4. Improve performance with large trees
5. Add keyboard navigation between items

### Medium-term (3-6 months)

1. Implement rich text editing
2. Add support for images and other media
3. Develop mobile-optimized layout and interactions
4. Create themes and customization options
5. Add data backup and restore functionality

### Long-term (6+ months)

1. Implement real-time collaboration features
2. Develop server-side storage and synchronization
3. Add user authentication and authorization
4. Create sharing capabilities
5. Add comments and annotations

## Recent Achievements

The project has successfully implemented all core functionality for hierarchical item management, including:

1. A clean, intuitive user interface with context menus and tooltips
2. Drag and drop capabilities for item organization with visual indicators
3. Clipboard integration for both Markdown and HTML import/export
4. History management with undo/redo functionality and session persistence
5. Local storage for data persistence with automatic saving
6. Multi-line text support in items
7. Keyboard shortcuts for common actions

## Current Development Focus

The current development focus is on stabilizing the existing features and preparing for the next phase of development, which will likely include:

1. Enhanced export/import capabilities with direct file support
2. Performance optimizations for large trees
3. Search and filtering functionality
4. Support for multiple maps/documents
5. Improved mobile support
